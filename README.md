# Shell-Scripts
EU > 15 GB on Mac Prompt.


This script is intended to be used as a maintenance script to proactively check if an End User's computer has less than 15 GB of space left on their main internal drive. If it determines it has less than the specified amount then it will prompt the user indicating how much space is currently on their Mac and what the 5 largest files within their home direcotry are. I used JamfHelper to prompt the user. 

Feel free to modify and adjust the script according to the needs of your enviornment. Commented on every section to facilitate adjusting the script.
